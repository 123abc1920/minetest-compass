1. Left click at point block with compass.

### API

**The name and the coordinates of blocks** are stored in **mod_storage**, key is **"compasses"**. 

Function ```changeCompass``` *(line 161)* starts when left click with compass in hand. If there is point block near, then compass gets attached to it.

Else function ```compassImg``` *(line 106)* starts. It controls the arrow.

In the drawing the **red** point is the **point block**, **green** is **player**. **Blue** line is **direction of view**. **Yellow** line built with two points - block point and player coordinates.

Blue and yellow lines are 2D **vectors** *(x-z coordinates)*. **Black** is **angle A between vectors**. It calculates with formula:
```
ab=|a||b|cosA
```
Then use **cross product of vectors** to determine where block is located regarding player`s line of view. If it is on the right then add 180 to **angle A**.

The arrow of compass deviates by an angle A.
